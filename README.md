# Getting Started with Create React App

## How to install
This is the instruction of install the react frontend in Ubuntu. 
### unzip
Unzip the code file and put it to any folder you want

### setup environment
Find the .env file in ./src folder. Change the value of REACT_APP_IP to be the ip address of your backend API.
Change the value of REACT_APP_API to be the API name of your API.

### install npm
install npm using the following instruction:
https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-node-js-on-ubuntu-20-04/

### install dependency:
in terminal, type in: "npm install". Then wait all dependency to be installed.

### Change environmental variable (API IP)
As our front end will communicate with the backend, we need to modify the backend IP before we can use.
First find your backend PC's IP. To find the IP, you can use the terminal in your backend machince, type:
    
    ifconfig

Your IP will be the format of 192.***.***.***

Then, use terminal on your frontend folder (root dir). To change the environmental constant in the hidden file ".env" Type: 

    nano .env
    
Change the value of the REACT_APP_IP to be your backend IP address.

### enjoy:
using the following instruction to run the app.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
